# Week 02 - 2.06 Defining Functions Over Lists

## The product of an empty list is usually taken to be 1: why?
For the product, the base case is 1 because this is the neutral operator for the multiplication operation.

## Which of the two styles – direct recursion and tail recursion – do you find most natural? Why?
It depends on the problem at hand, for these particular cases, direct recursion felt more natural. Because there where not complex desisions to make based on the data being procesed.
